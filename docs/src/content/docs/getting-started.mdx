Starlight Site Graph is a [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin that seamlessly adds a customizable graph to your site,
visualizing links between your pages for easy navigation.

Check out the [configuration](/starlight-site-graph/configuration) guide to learn more about the plugin's features.

:::note[Note]
The styling on this website is provided by [Starlight Theme Obsidian](https://fevol.github.io/starlight-theme-obsidian),
which includes this plugin out of the box.
:::

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

:::caution[Warning]
This plugin requires a [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) version of at least `^0.28.0` - due to the use of the i18next localization system
in several components. An [Astro](https://astro.build) version equal or higher than `^4.14.0` is also required for type injection.

New features for this plugin will only be added to recent versions of Starlight/Astro, backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
Refer to the [CHANGELOG](/starlight-site-graph/changelog) for more information about specific changes.

<Steps>
    1. Starlight Site Graph is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/) that you can install using your favorite package manager:
        <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-site-graph" pkgManagers={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]} type="add" />
    2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.
        ```diff lang="js"
            // astro.config.mjs
            import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
            import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
        +   import starlightSiteGraph from 'starlight-site-graph'

            export default defineConfig({
                integrations: [
                    starlight({
        +               plugins: [starlightSiteGraph()],
                        title: 'My Docs',
                    }),
                ],
            })
        ```
	3. Add the Site Graph [content schema](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-a-collection-schema)
		to your pages to enable type checking on the page's frontmatter, you will need to
		define the `src/content/config.ts` file if it doesn't exist yet.
		```diff lang="ts"
			// content/docs/config.ts
		+	import { docsSchema } from '@astrojs/starlight/schema';
		+	import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
		+	import { pageSiteGraphSchema } from 'starlight-site-graph/schema';
		+
		+	export const collections = {
		+		docs: defineCollection({
		+			schema: docsSchema({
		+				extend: pageSiteGraphSchema
		+			})
		+		})
		+	};
		```
	4. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to see the graph in action.
</Steps>

That's it! You should now see the Starlight Site Graph is now added to your Starlight website.

If you want to configure the graph component, sitemap generation or backlinks, check out the [configuration](/starlight-site-graph/configuration) guide.

:::caution[Warning]
If you have a plugin which overrides the default `<PageSidebar>` component, it will likely not work, depending on
how the plugin is implemented. Check out this plugin's [`<PageSidebar>`](/starlight-site-graph/components/pagesidebar) component for reference.

While the plugin is mainly developed with Starlight support in mind, it is also possible to add the
[`<PageGraph>`](/starlight-site-graph/components/pagegraph) or [`<PageBacklinks>`](/starlight-site-graph/components/pagebacklinks) components
to regular Astro projects, though it will require a bit more manual setup.


<Steps>
	1. Starlight Site Graph is a package that contains an integration and several components, which you can install using your favorite package manager:
		<PackageManagers pkg="starlight-site-graph" pkgManagers={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]} type="add" />
	2. Add the sitemap generation integration of the plugin in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
		The `prefetch` option is required and will be enabled automatically if it wasn't set already,
		as the plugin requires it to function properly.
		```diff lang="js"
			// astro.config.mjs
		+ import sitegraphSitemapIntegration from 'starlight-site-graph/integration';
			import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
			export default defineConfig({
		+		prefetch: true,
				 integrations: [
						// ...
		+	 		sitegraphSitemapIntegration()
				 ]
			})
		```
		:::note[Note]
		The Sitemap integration provided by this package is _not_ the same as the official [`@astrojs/sitemap`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/) integration.
		Where the official sitemap integration maps page _contents_, this package's integration maps page _connections_.
		:::
	3. Add the Site Graph [content schema](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-a-collection-schema)
		to your pages to enable type checking on the page's frontmatter,
		you will need to define the `src/content/config.ts` file if it doesn't exist yet.<br/>
		If you already have a collection defined, you can extend the existing schema with the `siteGraphSchema`:
		```diff lang="ts"
			// content/docs/config.ts
		+	import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
		+	import { pageSiteGraphSchema } from 'starlight-site-graph/schema';
		+
		+	export const collections = {
		+		your-collection: defineCollection({
		+			schema: someSchema.extend(pageSiteGraphSchema),
		+		})
		+	};
		```
	4. Add the default style variables for this package into your CSS file (e.g. `src/styles/global.css`), or add your own:
		```diff lang="css"
			/* src/styles/global.css */
		/* Inlude the package's default variables */
		+ @import "starlight-site-graph/styles/variables.css";

		/* ... your other styles ... */

		/* Example of overriding some variables */
		+ :root {
		+ 	--slsg-graph-minimized-bg-color: #f0f0f0;
		+ }
		```

		You can also import the stylesheet only for the pages where you want to add a graph:
		```diff lang="astro"
		---
		// src/pages/my-page.astro
		+import "starlight-site-graph/styles/variables.css";
		import { PageGraph } from 'starlight-site-graph/components';
		---

		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam nec dui...
		```
	5. You can now add the plugin's [components](/starlight-site-graph/components) directly to your `.astro`, [`.mdx`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
		or [`.mdoc`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/) pages (for the latter two, the proper integrations need to be added).<br/>
		An example:
		```diff lang="astro"
		// src/pages/my-page.astro
		---
		import "starlight-site-graph/styles/variables.css";
		+import { PageGraph } from 'starlight-site-graph/components';
		---

		+ <!-- Renders a graph focused on a node matching the current page -->
		+ <PageGraph />

		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam nec dui...
		```
		For more info, check out the [components](/starlight-site-graph/components) guide.
	6. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to see the graph in action;
		only links from markdown content is included while in `dev` mode (see also: [sitemap explanation](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/sitemap/#development-server)).
</Steps>

## Common Issues

### Unexpected graph structure

When enabling this integration for the first time, it is useful to set the depth to the maximum (i.e. `depth: 5`),
so you can see all connections in the graph.

In some cases, it is possible that you have too many or too few connections in the graph:
- Every node is connected to every other node
- There are long chain-like structures in the graph
- All nodes are isolated

The integration's [sitemap generation](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/sitemap/) parses links in both frontmatter,
Markdown content and the rendered HTML of your pages.
It is possible that you will have to change the [`sitemapConfig`](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/sitemap/)
to include/exclude certain links or pages.


### Disallowed MIME Type error
If the graph does not show up, and you see the following error in the browser console:

```txt wrap
Script from "http://localhost:4321/node_modules/starlight-site-graph/assets/svgs/XYZ.svg?import&raw"
was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type ("inage/svg+xml").
```

You should delete the `.astro` folder in the root of your project, and if necessary, restart the development server.


### `process` is not defined error

If the graph does not show up, and you see the following error in the browser console:

```txt wrap
Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
```

This is likely due to an outdated version of the `picomatch` dependency,
included by Astro via the `anymatch` package (which depends on an old version of `picomatch`).

To fix this issue, define an `overrides` in your `package.json` file to force the use of `picomatch` version `^4.0.3` or higher:

```diff lang="json"
{
	"dependencies": {
		"...": "..."
		"starlight-site-graph": "^0.5.0",
		"...": "..."
	},
+ "overrides": {
+	    "picomatch": "^4.0.3"
+ }
}
```

Then, force reinstall your dependencies by running the appropriate command for your package manager, or by manually
deleting the `node_modules` folder.

After that, the issue should be resolved.


### Visual inconsistencies

If elements included by this package look or feel off, it is likely due to an incorrect `@layer` order in your CSS.

For example, if you are using Tailwind CSS, make sure that its layers are defined _before_ the `sitegraph` layer:

```diff lang="css"
@layer base, components, utilities, sitegraph;
```
