Starlight Site Graph is a [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin that seamlessly adds a customizable graph to your site,
visualizing links between your pages for easy navigation.

Check out the [configuration](/starlight-site-graph/configuration) guide and [examples](/starlight-site-graph/examples)
to learn more about the plugin's features.

:::note[Note]
The styling on this website is provided by [Starlight Theme Obsidian](https://fevol.github.io/starlight-theme-obsidian),
which includes this plugin out of the box.
:::

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

:::caution[Warning]
This plugin requires a [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) version of at least `^0.28.0` - due to the use of the i18next localization system
in several components. An [Astro](https://astro.build) version equal or higher than `^4.14.0` is also required for type injection.

<Steps>
    1. Starlight Site Graph is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/) that you can install using your favorite package manager:
        <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-site-graph" />
    2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.
        ```diff lang="js"
            // astro.config.mjs
            import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
            import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
        +   import starlightSiteGraph from 'starlight-site-graph'

            export default defineConfig({
                integrations: [
                    starlight({
        +               plugins: [starlightSiteGraph()],
                        title: 'My Docs',
                    }),
                ],
            })
        ```
	3. Add the Site Graph [content schema](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-a-collection-schema)
		to your pages to enable type checking on the page's frontmatter, you will need to
		define the `src/content/config.ts` file if it doesn't exist yet.
		```diff lang="ts"
			// content/docs/config.ts
		+	import { docsSchema } from '@astrojs/starlight/schema';
		+	import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
		+	import { pageSiteGraphSchema } from 'starlight-site-graph/schema';
		+
		+	export const collections = {
		+		docs: defineCollection({
		+			schema: docsSchema({
		+				extend: pageSiteGraphSchema
		+			})
		+		})
		+	};
		```
	4. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to see the graph in action.
</Steps>

That's it! You should now see the Starlight Site Graph is now added to your Starlight website.

If you want to configure the graph component, sitemap generation or backlinks, check out the [configuration](/starlight-site-graph/configuration) guide.

:::caution[Warning]
If you have a plugin which overrides the default `<PageSidebar>` component, it will likely not work, depending on
how the plugin is implemented. Check out this plugin's [`<PageSidebar>`](/starlight-site-graph/components/pagesidebar) component for reference.

While the plugin is mainly developed with Starlight support in mind, it is also possible to add the
[`<PageGraph>`](/starlight-site-graph/components/pagegraph) or [`<PageBacklinks>`](/starlight-site-graph/components/pagebacklinks) components
to regular Astro projects (without a sidebar), though it will require a little more manual setup.


<Steps>
	1. Starlight Site Graph is a package that contains an integration and several components, which you can install using your favorite package manager:
		<PackageManagers pkg="starlight-site-graph" />
	2. Add the sitemap generation integration of the plugin in your `astro.config.mjs` file. You _may_ need to enable `prefetch` if you are encountering errors.
		```diff lang="js"
			// astro.config.mjs
		+ import sitegraphSitemapIntegration from 'starlight-site-graph/integration';
			import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
			export default defineConfig({
		+		prefetch: true,
				 integrations: [
						// ...
		+	 		sitegraphSitemapIntegration()
				 ]
			})
		```
		:::note[Note]
		The Sitemap integration provided by this package is _not_ the same as the official [`@astrojs/sitemap`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/) integration.
		The difference lies in the fact the official integration maps _contents_ while the package's integration maps _connections_.
		:::
	3. Add the Site Graph [content schema](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-a-collection-schema)
		to your pages to enable type checking on the page's frontmatter,
		you will need to define the `src/content/config.ts` file if it doesn't exist yet.<br/>
		If you already have a collection defined, you can extend the existing schema with the `siteGraphSchema`:
		```diff lang="ts"
			// content/docs/config.ts
		+	import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
		+	import { pageSiteGraphSchema } from 'starlight-site-graph/schema';
		+
		+	export const collections = {
		+		your-collection: defineCollection({
		+			schema: someSchema.extend(pageSiteGraphSchema),
		+		})
		+	};
		```
	4. You can now add the plugin's [components](/starlight-site-graph/components) directly to your `.astro`, [`.mdx`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
		or [`.mdoc`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/) pages (for the latter two, the proper integrations need to be added).<br/>
		An example:
		```mdx
		// src/content/docs/my-page.mdx
		---
		title: "My Page"
		---
		import { PageGraph } from 'starlight-site-graph/components'

		<!-- This will render a graph centered on the current page -->
		<PageGraph />

		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam nec dui...

	5. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to see the graph in action.
