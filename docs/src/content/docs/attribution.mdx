## People
This project would not have been possible without the help of [Lemons](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/),
who made large improvements to the graph's rendering logic and fixed many bugs.

Further I'd like to thank all the helpful people in the [Astro Discord](https://discord.gg/astro),
such as [HiDeoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo/), [Delucis](https://github.com/delucis) and [Kapaai](https://www.kapa.ai/)
for helping me to figure out how to solve some of the more difficult problems I encountered,
and giving many helpful suggestions on how to improve the project.


## Code
This project was originally based on [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)'s
graph component, which was then heavily modified to be more extensible, and integrate better
with Astro/Starlight's ecosystem.

The project also makes use of the following libraries:
- **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/):** Graph simulation
- **[Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/):** Framework used for rendering the graph
- **[Pixi Stats](https://github.com/Prozi/pixi-stats):** Pixi.js FPS counter
- **[micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/):** Glob pattern matching
