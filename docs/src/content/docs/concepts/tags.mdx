  pageTitle: Tags Explanation
---

Tags are a powerful way to group your content, without having to rely on the file system structure.
This plugin allows you to specify tags in your frontmatter (see [Frontmatter Configuration](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/frontmatter/sitemap#tags)),
and then use them to apply styles to nodes, or cluster them together in the graph (see [`tagRenderMode`](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/graph/tags#tag-rendering-mode)).
