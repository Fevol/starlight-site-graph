  pageTitle: Links Explanation
---

Each page in your website is connected to other pages by links,
these links can exist in the sidebar, header, footer, or within the content itself.

The package will go through each of your pages, and try to look for connections
to other pages (either via markdown links, or html tags). For more information on how this
happens, see the [Sitemap Explanation](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/sitemap) page.

Eventually in the graph, every link will connect two [nodes](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/nodes) together.

Links do not include the domain name, and are always relative to the root of your website.
This means that _all_ internal links will start with a `/`.

Depending on whether Astro's [`trailingSlash`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#trailingslash) option is set to `always`, `never` or `ignore`,
links may or may not end with a `/`.
This package will automatically fix links to match your trailing slash setting.
