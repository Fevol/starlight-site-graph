  pageTitle: Links Explanation
---

Each page in your website is connected to other pages by links,
these links can exist in the sidebar, header, footer, or within the content itself.

The package will go through each of your pages, and try to look for connections
to other pages (either via markdown links, or html tags). For more information on how this
happens, see the [Sitemap Explanation](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/sitemap) page.

Eventually in the graph, every link will connect two [nodes](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/nodes) together.
