  pageTitle: Nodes Explanation
---

In this package, a **node** corresponds to a page of a website, whether it is on your website, or someone else's.
Each page can only have one single node associated with it:
any subheadings (i.e. `/some/endpoint#heading`) will be folded under (`/some/endpoint`).

In Astro, a page can correspond to a `.md`, `.mdx`, `.mdoc` or `.astro` file; or is generated dynamically.
Depending on how this package is configured, the package will only include a subset of these
files in the [sitemap](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/sitemap).

The name of a node is determined by the following criteria, in order of precedence:
1. The [`sitemap.pageTitle`](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/frontmatter/sitemap/#page-title) frontmatter key,
2. The [`title`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/#title-required) frontmatter key,
3. The [`sitemapConfig.pageTitles`](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/sitemap/processing/#page-titles) configuration option,
4. Depending on the [`sitemapConfig.pageTitleFallbackStrategy`](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/sitemap/processing/#page-title-fallback-strategy) setting:
   - The most common link text (if any) used to link to this page
   - The last segment of the URL path (e.g. `Some Page` for `/abc/some-page/`)
