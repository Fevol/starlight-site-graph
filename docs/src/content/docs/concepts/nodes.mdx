  pageTitle: Nodes Explanation
---

In this package, a **node** corresponds to a page of a website, whether it
is on your website, or someone else's. Each page can only have one single node associated with it,
and subheadings (i.e. some/endpoint#heading) will be put under (some/endpoint).

In Astro, a page can correspond to a `.md`, `.mdx`, `.mdoc` or `.astro` file; or it is generated
dynamically. Depending on some configuration options, the package will only select a subset of these
files to be included in the [sitemap](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/sitemap).
