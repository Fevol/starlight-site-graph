## Actions

`actions` is an array of strings which specify which action buttons are included in the graph. \
The order of the actions in the array determines the order in which they are displayed in the top right of the graph.

For more information on what each individual action does, see the [Graph Actions](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/graph/graphactions) page.

<GraphExample id="action-configuration" config={{
	actions: ["fullscreen", "depth", "reset-zoom", "render-arrows", "render-external", "render-unresolved", "settings"],
	depth: 4,
}} baseConfig={frozenConfig} sitemap={randomNodeSitemap} slug={"node/"} configListener />
