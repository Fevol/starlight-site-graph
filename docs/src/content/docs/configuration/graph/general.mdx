## Depth

The `depth` option determines the depth of the graph, how many levels of links are shown.
- `-x`: Show the entire graph (the particular value of `x` is ignored).
- `0`: Show only the current node.
- `1`: Show the current node and its immediate neighbors.
- `x`: Show nodes up to `x` hops away from the current node.
- `5>`: Show the entire graph (the particular value of `x` is ignored).

When the depth is negative, the graph will show _all_ nodes in the graph, even if they are not reachable from the current node.

The graph will be traversed in the direction specified by the `depthDirection` option.

<GraphExample id="depth-showcase" config={{
	depth: 1,
}} baseConfig={{ ...largeFrozenSitemapConfig, scale: 0.65 }} sitemap={largeRandomNodeSitemap} slug={"node/"} configListener
	sliders={{
		"depth": {
			"title": "depth",
			"min": -1,
			"max": 5,
			"step": 1,
			"val": 1,
		}
	}}
/>

## Depth Direction

The `depthDirection` option determines the direction in which the links of the graph are expanded.
- `both`: The graph will be expanded in both directions.
- `incoming`: The graph will only be expanded in the direction of incoming links.
- `outgoing`: The graph will only be expanded in the direction of outgoing links.

This setting is ignored once a depth of 5 or higher is reached.

<GraphExample id="depth-direction-showcase" config={{
	depth: 1,
	depthDirection: "both",
}} baseConfig={{ ...largeFrozenSitemapConfig, scale: 0.65, minZoomArrows: 0.01, arrowSize: 4 }} sitemap={largeRandomNodeSitemap} slug={"node/"} configListener
	sliders={{
		depth: {
			"title": "depth",
			"min": -1,
			"max": 5,
			"step": 1,
			"val": 1,
		}
	}}
	buttons={{
	  "both": { config: { depthDirection: "both" } },
	  "incoming": { config: { depthDirection: "incoming" } },
	  "outgoing": { config: { depthDirection: "outgoing" } },
	}}
/>

## Actions

`actions` is an array of strings which specify which action buttons are included in the graph. \
The order of the actions in the array determines the order in which they are displayed in the top right of the graph.

For more information on what each individual action does, see the [Graph Actions](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/graph/actions) page.

<GraphExample id="action-configuration" config={{
	actions: ["fullscreen", "depth", "reset-zoom", "render-arrows", "render-external", "render-unresolved", "settings"],
	depth: 4,
}} baseConfig={frozenConfig} sitemap={randomNodeSitemap} slug={"node/"} configListener />

## Visibility Rules

The `visibilityRules` option is a list of [glob patterns](todo/) that determine when the [PageGraph component](todo/)
(the graph in the sidebar) will be shown. By default, the graph is shown on all pages where the sidebar is visible.

If `visibilityRules` is set to `["!starlight-site-graph/configuration/graph/general/", "**/*"]`, the graph would be shown for all pages except for the
current page.
