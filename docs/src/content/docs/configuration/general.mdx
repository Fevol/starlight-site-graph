This page discusses configuration for the top-level configuration of the Starlight Site Graph plugin.
The general configuration can only be set in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

```diff lang="js"
	// astro.config.mjs
	import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
	import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
	import starlightSiteGraph from 'starlight-site-graph'
	export default defineConfig({
		integrations: [
			starlight({
				plugins: [starlightSiteGraph({
+					debug: boolean,
+					overridePageSidebar: boolean,
+					graph: boolean,
+					backlinks: boolean,
+					trackVisitedPages: 'disable' | 'session' | 'local',
				})],
			 }),
		 ],
	 })
```

## Debug

The `debug` option is a boolean that enables or disables debug mode. When enabled, more internal stats will be logged,
and a performance graph will be shown on the page, visualizing the current performance of the graph in FPS.

## Override `<PageSidebar>`

The `overridePageSidebar` option is a boolean that enables or disables the `<PageSidebar>` override, removing
the `<PageGraph>` and `<PageBacklinks>` components from the sidebar, and using the vanilla or another overridden Starlight sidebar instead.
This flag is enabled by default, and unless you are planning to move the `<PageGraph>` and `<PageBacklinks>` components
to another location on the page, you probably want to keep it enabled.

```diff lang="js"
	// astro.config.mjs
	import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
	import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
	import starlightSiteGraph from 'starlight-site-graph'

	export default defineConfig({
		integrations: [
			starlight({
				plugins: [starlightSiteGraph({
+					overridePageSidebar: false
				})],
				title: 'My Docs',
			}),
		],
	})
```

## Render graph

If you want to _completely disable_ the graph from appearing anywhere, including the page sidebar, you can do so by setting `graph` to `false` in the plugin settings.
This setting is equivalent to setting the `visibilityRules` option to `[]` for the [`<PageGraph>`](/starlight-site-graph/components/pagegraph) component.

```diff lang="js"
    // astro.config.mjs
    import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
    import starlightSiteGraph from 'starlight-site-graph'

    export default defineConfig({
        integrations: [
            starlight({
                plugins: [starlightSiteGraph({
+                  graph: false
                })],
                title: 'My Docs',
            }),
        ],
    })
```

## Render backlinks

If you want to _completely disable_ the backlinks from appearing anywhere, including the page sidebar, you can do so by setting `backlinks` to `false` in the plugin settings.
This setting is equivalent to setting the `visibilityRules` option to `[]` for the [`<PageBacklinks>`](/starlight-site-graph/components/pagebacklinks) component.

```diff lang="js"
    // astro.config.mjs
    import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
    import starlightSiteGraph from 'starlight-site-graph'

    export default defineConfig({
        integrations: [
            starlight({
                plugins: [starlightSiteGraph({
+                  backlinks: false
                })],
                title: 'My Docs',
            }),
        ],
    })
```

## Track Visited Pages

The `trackVisitedPages` option is a string that enables or disables tracking of visited pages, and the
location where the visited pages are stored. The possible options are:

- `disable`: The visited pages are not stored.
- `session`: The visited pages are stored in the [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage).
- `local`: The visited pages are stored in the [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

By default, the visited pages are stored in session storage, meaning they are lost when the browser is closed.
The data is stored under the `starlight-site-graph--visited-pages` key.
