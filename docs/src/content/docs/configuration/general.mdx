This page discusses configuration for the top-level configuration of the Starlight Site Graph plugin.

## Debug

The `debug` option is a boolean that enables or disables debug mode. When enabled, more things will be logged,
and a performance graph will be shown, which visualizes the FPS of the graph.


## Track Visited Pages

The `trackVisitedPages` option is a string that enables or disables tracking of visited pages, and the
location where the visited pages are stored. The possible options are:

- `disable`: The visited pages are not stored.
- `session`: The visited pages are stored in the [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage).
- `local`: The visited pages are stored in the [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

By default, the visited pages are stored in session storage, meaning they are lost when the browser is closed.
The data is stored under the `starlight-site-graph--visited-pages` key.
