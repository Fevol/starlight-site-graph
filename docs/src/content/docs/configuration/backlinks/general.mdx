## Visibility Rules

The `visibilityRules` option is a list of [glob patterns](todo/) that determine when the [Backlinks component](todo/)
(the backlinks in the sidebar) will be shown. By default, the backlinks is shown on all pages where the sidebar is visible.

If `visibilityRules` is set to `["!starlight-site-graph/configuration/backlinks/general/", "**/*"]`, the backlinks would be shown for all pages except for the
current page.
