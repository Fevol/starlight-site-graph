## Links
The `links` frontmatter key allows you to specify additional links for a page.
These links can be used to create arbitrary connections between pages in the graph.

```md {4-6}
// src/content/docs/linked-page.md
---
title: My Page
links:
  - /another-page
  - /subdir/page
---

Some content
```

## Tags
The `tags` frontmatter key allows you to specify tags for a page.
These tags can be used to group together, or style, pages in the graph.
For more information, check out the [`tagRenderMode` option](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/graph/tags#tag-rendering-mode).

```md {4-6}
// src/content/docs/tagged-page.md
---
title: My Page
tags:
  - important
  - featured
---

Some content
```

## Sitemap Include
The `include` frontmatter key allows you to explicitly include or exclude a page from the sitemap.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Included">
		```md {4-5}
		// src/content/docs/my-page.md
		---
		title: My Page
		sitemap:
		  include: true
		---

		Some important text.
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Excluded">
		```md {4-5}
		// src/content/docs/my-page.md
		---
		title: My Page
		sitemap:
		  include: false
		---

		Some important text.
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Link Inclusion Rules
The `linkInclusionRules` frontmatter key allows you to filter which links may be included for this specific page,
based on their _target path_.
The rules are specified as a list of strings, where each string is a [glob pattern](/test).
The first rule that was matched, determines whether the link is included or not.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label='["**/*"]'>
		All links are included.
		```md {4-5} ins="[another page](/another-page)" ins="[subdirectory](/subdir/page)"
		// src/content/docs/my-page.md
		---
		title: A linked page
		sitemap:
		  linkInclusionRules: ["**/*"]
		---

		This page links to [another page](/another-page),
		and also to one in a [subdirectory](/subdir/page).
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='["!**/*", "**/*"]'>
		No links are included, because the first rule is always matched first.
		```md {4-5}
		// src/content/docs/my-page.md
		---
		title: A linked page
		sitemap:
		  linkInclusionRules: ["!**/*", "**/*"]
		---

		This page links to [another page](/another-page),
		and also to one in a [subdirectory](/subdir/page).
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='["**/subdir/*"]'>
		Only links to the `subdir` subdirectory are included.
		```md {4-5} ins="[subdirectory](/subdir/page)"
		// src/content/docs/my-page.md
		---
		title: A linked page
		sitemap:
		  linkInclusionRules: ["**/subdir/*"]
		---

		This page links to [another page](/another-page),
		and also to one in a [subdirectory](/subdir/page).
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>
