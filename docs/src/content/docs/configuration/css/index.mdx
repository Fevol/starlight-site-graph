This plugin mainly makes use of existing Starlight CSS variables to provide an easier out-of-the-box experience for
Starlight users.

:::caution[Warning]
If you installed the plugin in an Astro environment without Starlight, you will very likely need to provide your own
CSS variables to make the Graph component look nice.

A semi-sane default configuration is provided [in the variables section](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/css/variables#default-config).
:::

Since no `!important`'s were used in the making of this plugin, you can override all styling of the graph containers,
etc. However, you will _not_ be able to target the Graph elements themselves (i.e. nodes, links, labels), as these
exist within a `<Canvas>` context.

An example (albeit unrecommended) override of the CSS would look something like:
```css
// src/styles/global.css
:root[data-theme='light'] {
    --slsg-node-color: #00ff0a;
}

:root[data-theme='dark'] {
    --slsg-node-color: #ffea00;
}

.graph-container {
    border: 1px solid red;
}
```

## Cascade Layer
Like Starlight, the Starlight Site Graph package internally makes use of [cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers)
to manage the order of its styles.
This ensures a predictable CSS order and allows for simpler overrides.
Any custom unlayered CSS will override the default styles from the `sitegraph` layer.

If you are using cascade layers, you can use [`@layer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer)
in your [custom CSS](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles) to define
the order of precedence for different layers, relative to the base Starlight and this package's styles:

```css "starlight" "sitegraph"
/* src/styles/custom.css */
@layer my-base, starlight, sitegraph, my-overrides;
```

The example above defines a custom layer named `my-base`, applied before all the Starlight and the Site Graph's style layers,
and another named `my-overrides`, applied after all Starlight and Site Graph's layers.
Any styles in the `my-overrides` layer would take precedence over the Starlight and this package's layers,
but those layers will themselves override any styles set in the `my-base` layer.
