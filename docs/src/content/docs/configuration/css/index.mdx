import { LinkCardIcon } from '../../../../components';

This plugin mainly makes use of existing Starlight CSS variables to provide an easier out-of-the-box experience for
Starlight users.

:::caution[Warning]
If you installed the plugin in an Astro environment without Starlight, you will very likely need to provide your own
CSS variables to make the Graph component look nice.

A semi-sane default configuration is provided [in the variables section](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/css/variables#default-config).
:::

Since no `!important`'s were used in the making of this plugin, you can override all styling of the graph containers,
etc. However, you will _not_ be able to target the Graph elements themselves (i.e. nodes, links, labels), as these
exist within a `<Canvas>` context.

An example (unrecommended) override of the CSS would look something like:
```css
// src/styles/global.css
:root[data-theme='light'] {
    --slsg-node-color: #00ff0a;
}

:root[data-theme='dark'] {
    --slsg-node-color: #ffea00;
}

.graph-container {
    border: 1px solid red;
}
```
