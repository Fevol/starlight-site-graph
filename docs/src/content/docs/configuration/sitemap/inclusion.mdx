import { FileTree, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This page details configuration options for changing what is included in the sitemap.

## Content Root

The `contentRoot` option specifies from which directory files should be parsed to generate the sitemap.
By default, this is set to `./src/content/docs`. If you have your pages stored elsewhere, you will likely have to change this option.

**Example:**

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="./src/content/docs" icon="seti:happenings">
		<FileTree>
			- src
				- content
					- **docs**
						- **private** These files _are_ included in the sitemap
							- **basic-secretive-page.md**
							- **reactive-hidden-page.mdx**
							- **yet-another-special-page.mdoc**
							- **astronomically-exclusive.astro**
							- **...**
						- **public** These files _are_ included in the sitemap
							- **index.md**
							- **about.mdx**
							- **contact.mdoc**
							- **faq.astro**
							- **...**
		</FileTree>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="./src/content/docs/public" icon="list-format">
		<FileTree>
			- src
				- content
					- docs
						- private These files _are not_ included in the sitemap
							- basic-secretive-page.md
							- reactive-hidden-page.mdx
							- yet-another-special-page.mdoc
							- astronomically-exclusive.astro
							- ...
						- **public** These files _are_ included in the sitemap
							- **index.md**
							- **about.mdx**
							- **contact.mdoc**
							- **faq.astro**
							- **...**
		</FileTree>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Page Inclusion Rules

The `pageInclusionRules` option allows you to specify which pages should be included in the sitemap based on their _file path_.
The rules are specified as a list of strings, where each string is a [glob pattern](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/globs).
The first rule that was matched, determines whether the page is included or not.

If the inclusion of a page was specified in its frontmatter, it will take precedence over the rules specified here.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label='["**/*"]'>
		All files are included in the sitemap.
		<FileTree>
			- src
				- content
					- docs
						- private
							- **basic-secretive-page.md**
							- **reactive-hidden-page.mdx**
							- **yet-another-special-page.mdoc**
							- **astronomically-exclusive.astro**
							- **...**
						- public
							- **index.md**
							- **about.mdx**
							- **contact.mdoc**
							- **faq.astro**
							- **...**
		</FileTree>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='["**/*.md"]'>
		Only normal markdown files are included in the sitemap.
		<FileTree>
			- src
				- content
					- docs
						- private
							- **basic-secretive-page.md**
							- reactive-hidden-page.mdx
							- yet-another-special-page.mdoc
							- astronomically-exclusive.astro
							- ...
						- public
							- **index.md**
							- about.mdx
							- contact.mdoc
							- faq.astro
							- ...
		</FileTree>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='["public/**"]'>
		Only files in the `public` directory are included.
		<FileTree>
			- src
				- content
					- docs
						- private
							- basic-secretive-page.md
							- reactive-hidden-page.mdx
							- yet-another-special-page.mdoc
							- astronomically-exclusive.astro
							- ...
						- public
							- **index.md**
							- **about.mdx**
							- **contact.mdoc**
							- **faq.astro**
							- **...**
		</FileTree>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='["!**/*", "**/*"]'>
		No files are included, because the first rule is always matched first.
		<FileTree>
			- src
				- content
					- docs
						- private
							- basic-secretive-page.md
							- reactive-hidden-page.mdx
							- yet-another-special-page.mdoc
							- astronomically-exclusive.astro
							- ...
						- public
							- index.md
							- about.mdx
							- contact.mdoc
							- faq.astro
							- ...
		</FileTree>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='["!**/*.mdoc", "**/*"]'>
		Only files that are not `.mdoc` files are included.
		<FileTree>
			- src
				- content
					- docs
						- private
							- **basic-secretive-page.md**
							- **reactive-hidden-page.mdx**
							- yet-another-special-page.mdoc
							- **astronomically-exclusive.astro**
							- ...
						- public
							- **index.md**
							- **about.mdx**
							- contact.mdoc
							- **faq.astro**
							- ...
		</FileTree>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Link Inclusion Rules

The `linkInclusionRules` option allows you to specify which links should be included in the sitemap based on their _target path_.
The rules are specified as a list of strings, where each string is a [glob pattern](/starlight-site-graph/concepts/globs).
The first rule that was matched, determines whether the link is included or not.

If a link was specified in the frontmatter of a page, it will always be included, regardless of the rules specified here.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label='["**/*"]'>
		All links are matched.

		```md ins="[links](/link)" ins="[another link here](/here/another/link)" ins="[Astro](https://astro.build)" ins="[nowhere](https://no.w/here/)"
		// a-linked-document.md
		This document contains many [links](/link) to other pages.
		Here is one that goes to [another link here](/here/another/link).
		This one goes to [Astro](https://astro.build).
		And this one goes [nowhere](https://no.w/here/).
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='["**/link"]'>
		Only links that end in `/link` are matched.

		```md ins="[links](/link)" ins="[another link here](/here/another/link)"
		// a-linked-document.md
		This document contains many [links](/link) to other pages.
		Here is one that goes to [another link here](/here/another/link).
		This one goes to [Astro](https://astro.build).
		And this one goes [nowhere](https://no.w/here/).
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='["**/here/**"]'>
		Only links to the `here` subdirectory are matched.

		```md ins="[another link here](/here/another/link)" ins="[nowhere](https://no.w/here/)"
		// a-linked-document.md
		This document contains many [links](/link) to other pages.
		Here is one that goes to [another link here](/here/another/link).
		This one goes to [Astro](https://astro.build).
		And this one goes [nowhere](https://no.w/here/).
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='["!https://**/*", "**/*"]'>
		Only links that are not external are matched. This is equivalent to [`includeExternalLinks: false`](/starlight-site-graph/configuration/sitemap/inclusion/#include-external-links).

		```md ins="[links](/link)" ins="[another link here](/here/another/link)"
		// a-linked-document.md
		This document contains many [links](/link) to other pages.
		Here is one that goes to [another link here](/here/another/link).
		This one goes to [Astro](https://astro.build).
		And this one goes [nowhere](https://no.w/here/).
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Include External Links

The `includeExternalLinks` option toggles whether external links will be included in the sitemap.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="True" icon="approve-check">
		```md ins="[a boring page](/another-page)" ins="[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build)"
		// a-cool-document.md
		This is a *cool* document
			which links to [a boring page](/another-page).
		Because I am a **very cool** document,
			I will also link to [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="False" icon="close">
		```md ins="[a boring page](/another-page)"
		// a-cool-document.md
		This is a *cool* document
			which links to [a boring page](/another-page).
		Because I am a **very cool** document,
			I will also link to [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>
